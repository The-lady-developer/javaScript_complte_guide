javaScript - Complete Guide (Under construction)

What is javaScript?
JavaScript is the programming language of the Web. The majority of modern websites use JavaScript, and all modern web browsers—on desktops, game consoles, tablets, and smart phones—include JavaScript interpreters, making JavaScript the most ubiquitous programming language in history. JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers must learn: HTML to specify the content of web pages, CSS to specify the presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the behavior of web pages.

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped interpreted programming language that is well-suited to object-oriented    and functional programming styles. JavaScript derives its syntax from Java, its first-class functions from Scheme, and its prototype-based inheritance from Self. 

javaScript =! Java
* The name “JavaScript” is actually somewhat misleading.
* javaScript is completely different from Java.
* javaScript is object based programming language whereas java is object oriented programming language.
* Java creates application that can run in a virtual machine or browser whereas javaScript runs on browser.

JavaScript was created at Netscape in the early days of the Web, and technically, “JavaScript” is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) used to describe Netscape’s (now Mozilla’s) implementation of the language. Netscape submitted the language for standardization to ECMA—the European Computer Manufacturer’s    Association—and because of trademark issues, the standardized version ofmthe language was stuck with the awkward name “ECMAScript.” For the same trademark reasons, Microsoft’s version of the language is formally known as “JScript.” In practice, just about everyone calls the language JavaScript. This book uses the name “ECMAScript” only to refer to the language standard.
For the last decade, all web browsers have implemented version 3 of the ECMAScript standard and there has really been no need to think about version numbers: the language standard was stable and browser      implementations of the language were, for the most part.Recently, an important new version of the language has been defined as ECMAScript version 6.

Let's discuss everything together related to javaScript from beginner to advance.
