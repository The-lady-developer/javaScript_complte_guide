//JavaScript supports two styles of comments.
//Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript.
//Any text between the characters /* and */ is also treated as a comment.
//these comments may span multiple lines but may not be nested.

// This is a single-line comment.//
/* This is also a comment */  
// and here is another comment.
/* 
* This is yet another comment. 
* It has multiple lines. 
*Hi!
